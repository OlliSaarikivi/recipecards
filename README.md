# Recipes Cards

This is a collection of my often-used recipes that I want to have easily referencable in the kitchen.
These are printable onto 3x5 inch index cards.
This format has a few distinct advantages:

- The small footprint is convenient in small kitchens. Wooden boxes to store these with integrated stands for the cards during cooking are readily available.
- The cards are easily replaceable, meaning you don't have to worry about protecting them from splashes. Printed cards are less work to replace than hand written ones.
- They support freeform organization by meal, season, mains/sides, dietary restrictions, etc.
- Unlike cookbooks you can omit any recipes you're not interested in.

Beware that some of the recipes are heavily abbreviated to fit the small format, which might make them hard to follow if they are not familiar in advance.
